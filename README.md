## Requirements

To install requirements:

Install Python 3.10 and
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Simulation Commands

To generate the figures in the simulation part or the appendix part of the paper, you need to first run the commands for simulation and then run the corresponding "plotfig_*.py" file for plotting figures.
The output figures will be saved to PDF files in the folders "results_single" and "results_multi".
All the commands are presented in the following for different settings.

### Single-Link System

First run the following commands for different algorithms in the single-link system:

|                                  Method                                   | Command                                                              |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                 Probabilistic two-price policy (Proposed)                 | ```python main_single_queue.py --policy "learn_two_price_threshold"``` |
| Two-price policy - known demand and supply functions (Varma et al., 2023) | ```python main_single_queue.py --policy "known_two_price"```           |
